As a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. 
From these insights,our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. 

<a name="about"></a>
## About the company 
  
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. 

One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers,Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. 

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Insights & Recommendations

1.	Member riders are the primary customer segment, representing a significant majority of total riders. The focus should be on retaining and satisfying this segment as they are the main contributors to the bike-sharing service.
2.	Casual riders might be attracted by longer rides and higher average distances. Marketing efforts can be targeted to promote leisure rides, group rides, or scenic routes to further engage this customer segment.
3.	Although Casual riders spend more time per ride, the average distance is not significantly higher than Member riders. There could be an opportunity to encourage more exploration by Casual riders, leading to longer rides and potentially higher revenue per ride.
4.	The summer season sees the highest overall usage. The company can consider seasonal promotions, incentives, or events to capitalize on the increased demand during this time.
5.	Weekend usage is consistently higher for both rider types. Special promotions or events on weekends could attract more ridership and boost overall revenue.
6.	Member riders seem to use the bike-sharing service more frequently during weekdays, especially during working hours. The company could explore partnerships with local businesses or offer corporate membership plans to encourage bike commuting.
7.	Hourly usage patterns differ between Casual and Member riders, indicating varying usage behavior throughout the day. Targeted promotions, discounts, or rewards during specific hours can encourage ridership during less busy periods.
8.	Electric bikes are popular among Casual riders. The company could consider expanding the electric bike fleet and promoting their usage for an enhanced customer experience.
9.	The data shows that docked bikes have relatively lower usage. The company might want to investigate the reasons behind this and consider reallocating resources or promoting docked bikes through incentives.
10.	In-depth customer surveys and feedback analysis would provide valuable insights into customer preferences, pain points, and areas for improvement.
